CitiBike Tableau Homework

CitiBike has an exhaustive dataset available for Data Analysis.
Considering the time frame and restriction with Tableau public, I have considered data for the months of July, August and September.

As each and every trip is documented even the three months data gave a great prospective of the trend in the market.

Various grpahs/dashboards are considered during the study to analyse and understand various attributes of the dataset

1. Graph 1 gives an overview of the number of trips in each month and how average trip duration has changed each month.
2. Graph 2 decribes the busiest hour of the day - which not surprisingly are the times between 7am -9am and 4pm to 7pm. 
   Hence, we can say, the rides are being taken mostly by working professionals who use bikes to cover the last mile distance to their workplace.
3. Graph 3,4 and 5 sums up the how the trend of CitiBike customer's in term of demographics (age, gender and type). Interestingly, women 
   riders are less than men riders, but, the avergae trip duration of women is higher than those of men. People who have an annual 
   subscrption form a form chunk of the customers taking rides. Whereas, subscribers (one-time customers) have a higher average trip 
   duration.
4. Visuals 6 to 11 shows the station locations, average trip duration from each location and the numder of trips taken from start and end
   stations.
5. Mostly all graphs are self-explanatory but, have tried to summarize everything in the form of dashboards and stories.
6. PS: In Bottom 10 end stations graphs - there are two stations namely Brunkswick Street, only one trip ended at this station but average
   trip duration was 787,220 secs. Another such example is where station name is Union St., number of records =1 but average trip
   duration is 605,277. Hence, other 8 stations become negligible.
